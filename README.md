# Heterogeneous Training 
sharable code and reports of my IISc Research on heterogeneous training of large-scale DNNs on CPU-GPU platforms.

Code is available in the "CodeBase" folder. Most of the code is implemented pytorch's distributed api and multiprocessing environment. for any queries, write to dheemanth@fsid-iisc.in 

Most recent benchmarks on heterogeneous memory management and 41B GPT training can be found in the "recent" folder. Our team is presently focussed on deepspeed and colossal ai.
